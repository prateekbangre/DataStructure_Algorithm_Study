**Data Structure**
-
Data structures are divided into two types.
* Linear Data Structures
  * Arrays
  * List (Linked List)
    * Singly linked list
    * Circular linked lists
    * Doubly linked list
  * Stack (LIFO)
    * Stack using Array
    * Stack using LinkedList
  * Queue (FIFO)
    * Queue using Array
    * Queue using LinkedList
    * Circular Queue
    * Double Ended Queue
    
* Non - Linear Data Structures
    * Tree
      * Binary Trees
      * Binary Search Trees
    * Graph
    * Dictionaries
    * Heaps
      * Min Heap
      * MiX Heap
    * Tries, Etc.,

* HashTable

**Linked List**
-
The linked list is a linear data structure that contains a sequence of elements such that each element links to its next element in the sequence. Each element in a linked list is called "Node".

**Searching Algorithm**
=
**Linear Search**
-
Linear search is used on a collections of items. It relies on the technique of traversing a list from start to end by exploring properties of all the elements that are found on the way.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

**Binary Search**
-
Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

**Time Complexity:** O(log n)

**Sorting Algorithm**
=
**Selection sort**
-
The Selection sort algorithm is based on the idea of finding the minimum or maximum element in an unsorted array and then putting it in its correct position in a sorted array.

**Time Complexity:** O(n*n) or O(n^2)
